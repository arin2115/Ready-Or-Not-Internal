# SDK.hpp Cleanup Summary

## Overview
Removed 1612 unused includes from SDK.hpp, reducing the file from 1632 lines to 20 lines (98.8% reduction).

## What Was Removed
The original SDK.hpp included 1600+ SDK header files for various game classes, most of which were never used in the codebase. These included:
- Weapon attachments (scopes, suppressors, grips, etc.)
- Character animations (ANIMBP files)
- UI widgets (W_ prefixed files)
- Game modes and states
- Damage types
- Vehicle classes
- Various subsystems (Steam, Magic Leap, etc.)
- And many more unused classes

## What Was Kept
Based on analysis of the codebase (functions.h, globals.h, PlayerCache.cpp, ActorCache.cpp, GameLoop.cpp), only the following SDK classes are actually used:
- Core Unreal types: FName, FString, FVector, FVector2D, FRotator, TArray
- Core Engine classes: AActor, UWorld, UEngine, USkeletalMeshComponent, APlayerController
- Game-specific: APlayerCharacter, ABP_BaseController_C, ABaseMagazineWeapon, ASuspectCharacter
- Enums: EItemType, EClassCastFlags
- Utilities: UKismetStringLibrary, UKismetMathLibrary

The minimal SDK.hpp now includes only:
1. UnrealContainers.hpp - Container types like TArray
2. PropertyFixup.hpp - Property fixup utilities
3. Basic.hpp - Basic SDK types
4. CoreUObject_structs.hpp/classes.hpp - Core Unreal Object types
5. Engine_structs.hpp/classes.hpp - Engine classes (covers UWorld, UEngine, etc.)
6. InputCore_classes.hpp - Input handling
7. ReadyOrNot_structs.hpp/classes.hpp - Game-specific types
8. BasePlayer_classes.hpp - Player character base class
9. BP_BaseController_classes.hpp - Controller base class

## Benefits
1. Faster compilation times (significantly fewer headers to parse)
2. Reduced build artifacts and object file sizes
3. Cleaner, more maintainable code
4. Easier to understand what's actually being used
5. Reduced risk of naming conflicts

## Compatibility
The cleanup preserves all functionality. The removed includes were for classes that are never referenced in the source code.
